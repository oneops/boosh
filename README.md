# Description

[Boo](https://github.com/oneops/boo) Shell (`boosh`)

Based on [GShell 3](https://github.com/jdillon/gshell).

**WARNING** Work-in-progress; GShell 3 and Boosh are undergoing rapid changes.

# License

[Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

# Building

## Requirements

* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) 3.5+ (prefer included maven-wrapper)
* [Java](http://java.oracle.com/) 8+

Check out and build:

    git clone git://github.com/oneops/boosh.git
    cd boosh
    ./build rebuild

After this completes, you can unzip the assembly and launch the shell:

    ./build run

# Running

The `build run` here is just a simple helper to run the previously built assembly, and is equivalent to:

    ./target/boosh-*/bin/boosh

Use the 'help' command for further assistance.

    help boo

Should produce something like:

    Help pages in group boo:
      config      Get and set configuration options
      create      Create a new assembly
      get-ips     Display IP addresses
      list        List assemblies
      procedure   Invoke a procedure
      remove      Remove deployed configurations
      retry       Retry deployments
      status      Get status of deployments
      template    Display template
      update      Update assemblies

Commands can be executed w/o an interactive shell as well:

    ./build run boo/config

Produces something similar to:

    [default]
      cloud: 
      username: 
      email: 
      host: 
      api_key: XXXX
      organization: 

# Known Issues

## TERM=ansi

  `TERM=ansi` is known to cause strange behavior.  Workaround is to use `TERM=xterm-256color` or similar.
  
  ie. `export TERM=xterm-256color` in the native shell to configure the TERM.
